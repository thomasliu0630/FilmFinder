# FilmFinder: A Hidden Gems Movie Recommender

**FilmFinder** is a personalized film discovery tool that helps users find *hidden gem* movies based on genre, platform availability, and quality metrics ‚Äî using real-time data from The Movie Database (TMDb). Whether you're a casual viewer or a movie buff, FilmFinder uncovers lesser-known films that are truly worth watching.

## Project Motivation

Many streaming platforms are saturated with overly promoted or mainstream content. As a film enthusiast, I built FilmFinder to surface high-quality, under-the-radar titles that are available to stream, using data analytics and recommendation logic. This project also serves as an end-to-end demonstration of my data wrangling, API integration, and visualization skills.

## Features

- **Real-Time API Access**: Pulls live data from TMDb via `/discover/movie`
- **Hidden Gem Filtering**: Filters by user-defined criteria
